# Research Paper Summary Template

## Purpose

Guided summarization of research papers for literature review. From Chapter 12.

## The Prompt

```
Summarize this paper for a researcher in [your field] who wants to know:

1. **Problem**: What problem does this paper address?
2. **Contribution**: What is the main contribution or result?
3. **Method**: What methodology or techniques are used?
4. **Limitations**: What are the key limitations the authors acknowledge?
5. **Relevance**: How does this relate to [specific topic you care about]?

Keep each section to 2-3 sentences.

Flag any claims I should verify independently.
```

## Comparing Multiple Papers

```
I have summaries of these papers on [topic]:

Paper 1: [paste summary or title + abstract]
Paper 2: [paste summary or title + abstract]
Paper 3: [paste summary or title + abstract]

Help me organize them:
1. What are the main approaches represented?
2. Where do they agree and disagree?
3. What gaps exist that none of them address?
4. How might I position my work relative to these?
```

## Critical Reading

```
Read this paper critically:

[paste abstract or key sections]

Identify:
1. Unstated assumptions
2. Potential weaknesses in methodology
3. Claims that seem overstated
4. Missing comparisons or baselines
5. Questions a skeptical reviewer might ask
```

## Related Work Section Draft

```
I'm writing a related work section covering these papers:

[list papers with one-line descriptions]

My contribution: [describe your work]

Draft related work that:
1. Groups papers by approach
2. Highlights how each relates to my work
3. Identifies the gap my work fills
4. Follows academic writing conventions

Note: I will verify all claims against the original papers.
```

## Citation Verification

```
Here are citations in my related work section:

[paste citations with how you describe them]

For each citation:
1. Does my description accurately reflect the paper's claims?
2. Am I citing the right paper for this point?
3. Are there obvious missing citations for [topic]?
4. Any citations that seem tangential and could be cut?

Note: Flag anything you cannot verify.
```

## Proof Assistant Collaboration

```
I'm proving this lemma in [Lean/Coq/Isabelle]:

[paste lemma and current proof state]

The goal is: [paste goal]

Suggest 3-5 tactics I might try next, with brief explanations.
I will test them—don't worry about certainty.
