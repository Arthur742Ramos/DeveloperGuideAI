# MVP Scoping Template

## Purpose

Scope side projects to avoid building too much. From Chapter 13.

## Idea Clarification

```
I have an idea for an app:

[describe idea in 2-3 sentences]

Help me clarify:
1. What is the core job-to-be-done for users?
2. Who exactly is the target user? Be specific.
3. What is the simplest version that delivers value?
4. What existing solutions do people use today?
5. Why would someone switch to this?

Be honest if the idea seems unclear or the audience too broad.
```

## MVP Scoping

```
App idea: [one sentence]
Target user: [specific description]

Propose 3 MVP scopes:

**Scope A (Weekend build)**
- Can be built in a weekend
- What is the absolute minimum?
- Features: [3-5 bullets]
- NOT included: [explicit exclusions]
- Biggest risk:

**Scope B (2-week build)**
- What adds clear value over Scope A?
- Features: [3-5 bullets]
- NOT included: [explicit exclusions]
- Biggest risk:

**Scope C (Month build)**
- What would feel "complete"?
- Features: [3-5 bullets]
- NOT included: [explicit exclusions]
- Biggest risk:

Help me resist the urge to over-build.
```

## User Story Development

```
For my app that [one sentence description]:

Write 5 user stories:
"As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

Then for the most important story, describe:
1. What screen the user sees
2. What actions they can take
3. What happens after each action
4. What the empty state looks like (before any data)

Keep it simple—I'm a solo developer.
```

## Marketing Copy

```
App: [name]
What it does: [2-3 sentences]
Target user: [who]

Write:
1. Tagline (under 10 words)
2. Short description (under 170 characters)
3. Full description (3-5 short paragraphs)
4. 3-5 screenshot captions

Style:
- Friendly and concrete, not buzzwordy
- Focus on problems solved, not features
- Avoid overpromising
```

## Landing Page Copy

```
I'm launching [product] for [audience].

Write landing page copy:
1. Headline: Clear value proposition
2. Subheadline: Who it's for and what they get
3. 3 key benefits (with short explanations)
4. Social proof section placeholder
5. Call-to-action button text

Then write onboarding text:
1. Welcome screen (1-2 sentences)
2. First-time empty state (encourage first action)
3. Success message after first action

Keep language simple. This is a side project, not enterprise software.
```

## Scope Reduction

```
I want to build [feature list].

This is too much for an MVP. Help me cut:

1. Which features are core to the value proposition?
2. Which are nice-to-have that can come in v2?
3. Which solve problems users don't actually have?
4. What's the smallest thing I could launch with?

Be ruthless. I can always add features later.
```

## "Not Included" List

```
For this MVP scope:
[list features you're including]

Write the "NOT included" list:
- Features we're explicitly deferring
- Scope boundaries
- Things users might expect but won't get

This helps me resist scope creep.
```
