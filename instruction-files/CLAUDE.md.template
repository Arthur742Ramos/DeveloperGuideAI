## Architecture

[BRIEF_ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION]

Key directories:
- `src/` - [what's here]
- `tests/` - [what's here]
- `[OTHER_DIR]/` - [what's here]

## Conventions

### Code Style
- [Your primary style guide, e.g., "Follow PEP 8" or "Use Prettier defaults"]
- [Naming convention, e.g., "snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes"]
- [Import ordering convention]

### Patterns
- [Your service/component pattern, e.g., "Services in src/services/ follow the repository pattern"]
- [Error handling pattern, e.g., "Wrap external calls in try/catch, use custom AppError class"]
- [State management pattern if applicable]

### Testing
- [Test file naming, e.g., "Tests mirror source structure: src/foo.ts -> tests/foo.test.ts"]
- [Coverage requirements, e.g., "New code requires >80% coverage"]
- [Test framework and assertion style]

## Key Files

Understanding these files first helps with most tasks:

- `[PATH_TO_MAIN_ENTRY]` - Application entry point
- `[PATH_TO_CONFIG]` - Configuration loading
- `[PATH_TO_TYPES]` - Core type definitions
- `[PATH_TO_UTILS]` - Shared utilities

## Do Not

- Modify files in `[GENERATED_DIR]/` (auto-generated)
- Change database schema without migration
- Commit `.env` or files matching `[SECRETS_PATTERN]`
- [Other project-specific constraints]

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new [FEATURE_TYPE]
1. Create file in `[LOCATION]`
2. Follow pattern in `[EXAMPLE_FILE]`
3. Register in `[REGISTRATION_LOCATION]`
4. Add tests in `[TEST_LOCATION]`

### [OTHER_COMMON_TASK]
[Brief steps]

## Dependencies

External services this project talks to:
- [SERVICE_1]: [what it's used for]
- [SERVICE_2]: [what it's used for]

## Learned Constraints

<!-- Add constraints discovered through iteration -->
<!-- Example: "Always run typecheck before committing (added after CI failures)" -->

## Customization Notes

Delete this section after customizing. Replace all `[BRACKETS]` with your values.

Sections to definitely fill in:
1. Quick Reference commands
2. Key Files paths
3. Do Not constraints
4. At least one Common Task
